# renew-subscription-reminder
I have an obscene amount of subscriptions and it's really hard to keep track of expiration dates so I would like to create an app that I can input the expiration date and receive a repeating, daily reminder to renew the subscription starting at 30 days before it expires and counting down.
I would also like to have multiple users for my household family members.
